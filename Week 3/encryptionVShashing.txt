Encryption --> we pass any string and it converts it into any random human inreadable string, looking at which we could never undrestand what was entered.
            --> but it should return the same input when we put that random human unreadble string.
            --> basically we hash the string to the very random strnig, which has no meaning around the world.

            Boradly we pass a string and using super secret we get some random string. This is encryption.
            Then in decryption, we pass the random string with the super secret to get the string that we had passed.
