** JOINS


-> Relationships is easy but joins is hard.
-> benefit that joins give is that we can run single command to get data from two related table.


For example we are asked to  fetch user details and their addresses, what SQL query would we write?

-> BAD APPRAOCH

    // fetches user's details
    SELECT id, username, email
    FROM users
    WHERE id = YOUR_USER_ID;

    //fetches user's addresses
    SELECT city, country, state, pincode
    FROM addresses
    WHERE id = YOUR_USER_ID

-> USING JOINS

    SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, a.city. a.state, a.country, a.pincode
    FROM users u
    JOIN addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
    WHERE u.id  = YOUR_USER_ID;


Benefits of using joints
- Reduced Latency
- Simplified Application Logic
- Transactional Integrity
