## Custom Hooks in react

- Side Effects -> In react the concept of side effects encompasses any operations that reach outside the functional scope of a React component. These operations can affect other components, interact with the browser, or perform asynchronous data fetching.


-> anything not related to rendering(putting things on dom and remove from dom) are called side effects.

## Common Hooks:
 - useState
 - useEffect
 - useCallback
 - useMemo
 - useRef
 - useContext
