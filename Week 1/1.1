Single threaded ---> only a single core will be used to run a program. Example of me going to buy curd and me going to get a print. It will take time. This is single threaded. But if I go to buy curd and my friend goes to take print out. It is multi threaded. Go long is a multithreaded language.

Asynchronous Nature ---> Asynchronous do not necessarily run on the same core. Example - Harkirat is teaching for 1 hour continuously and someone asks him go and get a chocolate and then continue teaching for another 1 hour. He tells his friend to get the chocolate meanwhile he continues teaching for the another one hour. Once his friends brings the choclate he gives it to the person who has aksed for it. Basically things which are complex is asynchronouos. Like reading from a file etc...
